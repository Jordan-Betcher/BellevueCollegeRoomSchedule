# BellevueCollegeRoomSchedule
 
The version control for the code and documentation that make up [Bellevue College Room Schedule](http://bellevuecollegeroomschedule.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) a website that aggregates and displays when classrooms are open that I wish I had at the start of my college quarters.

As of Winter 2022 it doesn't work due to the api not providing the data.
