	Purpose
		This site's purpose is to allow students to get a feel for room availablity. When I was a student I wanted to know which rooms I could sit in an ~play~ study as I wanted for my next class in 3 hours... I didn't have something that told me if a room is available, but that doesn't mean you can't.

			This site uses the bellevue college's API, misses some class times. This site's api downloads the class times at the start of the quarter so changes after the quarter has been released won't show up.
