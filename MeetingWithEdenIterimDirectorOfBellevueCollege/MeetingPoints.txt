Meeting Points for when Jordan talks with Eden showcasing the BC Room Schedule Website and how it can benifit the college. Meeting is 1/30/20 at 10-11am in Bellevue College Room N216D.

Before:
	It's ok to admit nervousness, inexperiance, and acknowledge that his time is valuable

During:
	Project value:
		The college better utilize the empty classrooms
		Increase reputation of the college because students will have an easier time using the campus
		Clearing out hallways and other sitting areas because students can study in classrooms
		Teachers can find empty rooms to answer questions
		Can you think of something similar that this would be good for?
	
	Value of myself (focus on establishing myself economicly):
		I have experiance working on this project
		Demo that I can show/use

After (focus on him doing something for me):
	Where do we go from here?
	What issues need to be resolved to move forward?
	Is there anyone you can introduce/recommend me to?
	Would you be interested in talking for 30 minutes a month? (mentorship, depends how the conversation went)
